# simple-Python-Slot-by-Affifindsyou
My first Python Project :) . Keep in mind that it will only work if you execute the main_slot file in an editor... the command prompt won't work
I started programming with Python a week ago... I am very Proud of this Project because it's working and my very first one.
You can use the Files and improve it if you wan't. A credit would be nice but not necessary! :) Enjoy
And if you read this far please give me a Feedback on this Project and if it worked for you.
